**R017**
As a System Administrator, I want to configure notification policies, SLA thresholds, and templates, so that tenants can customise system behaviour.

- **Acceptance Criteria**
    - Given I am on the configuration console
    - When I edit notification or SLA settings
    - Then the system validates and applies the new policies across tenants

- **Traceability**: UC-012 Configure Notification and Policy Settings | NFRs: Configurability, Reliability, Security
