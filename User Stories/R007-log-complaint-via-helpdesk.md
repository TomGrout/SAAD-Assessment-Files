**R007**
As a Help Desk Agent, I want to log complaints received via phone or email, so that consumers without online access can still report issues.

- **Acceptance Criteria**
    - Given a consumer contacts me through assisted channels
    - When I record their complaint in the system
    - Then the complaint is created and a confirmation reference is sent to the consumer

- **Traceability**: UC-001 Register Complaint, UC-008 View Complaint Status | NFRs: Accessibility, Availability, Data Integrity
